## QNick
QNick is Kore's very much advanced nickname plugin for Minecraft servers. So what does it do?
*Note: this tutorial has SQL stripped out of it as this makes the code very complex*

Here is a run down of what QNick does in some simple code steps:

### Step 1
First is the `Nickname` class
```java
public class Nickname {
    private static void setDisplayName(@NotNull Player player, @NotNull Component nick) {
        player.displayName(nick);
    }

    private static NamespacedKey getKey() {
        return QNick.getNickKey();
    }


    public static Component get(@NotNull Player player) {
        if (player.getPersistentDataContainer().has(getKey(), PersistentDataType.STRING)) {
            return MiniMessage.miniMessage().deserialize(Objects.requireNonNull(player.getPersistentDataContainer().get(getKey(), PersistentDataType.STRING)));
        }
        return null;
    }

    public static void set(@NotNull Player player, @NotNull Component nick) {
        player.getPersistentDataContainer().set(getKey(), PersistentDataType.STRING, MiniMessage.miniMessage().serialize(nick));
        setDisplayName(player, nick);
    }

    public static void remove(@NotNull Player player) {
        player.getPersistentDataContainer().remove(getKey());
        player.displayName(Component.text(player.getName()));
    }

    public static boolean has(@NotNull Player player) {
        return player.getPersistentDataContainer().has(getKey(), PersistentDataType.STRING);
    }
}
```

Let's break this down further into the functions
```java
public static Component get(@NotNull Player player) {
    if (player.getPersistentDataContainer().has(getKey(), PersistentDataType.STRING)) {
        return MiniMessage.miniMessage().deserialize(Objects.requireNonNull(player.getPersistentDataContainer().get(getKey(), PersistentDataType.STRING)));
    }
    return null;
}
```

In this function we are getting the user's nickname by first checking if the user has a nickname, note that the function "getKey()" returns
```java
new NamespacedKey(this/*This is the Plugin instance*/, "nick");
```
from the main plugin. The `PersistentDataType.STRING` shows this value is a text value.

If the user is found to have a nickname it will return a `Component` from the AdventureAPI which is from a MiniMessage formatted string, you will see that this is how nicknames are stored in the next function explaination.

Next let's focus on setting a nickname
```java
public static void set(@NotNull Player player, @NotNull Component nick) {
    player.getPersistentDataContainer().set(getKey(), PersistentDataType.STRING, MiniMessage.miniMessage().serialize(nick));
    setDisplayName(player, nick);
}
```

Here it is a little simpler, we set the `PersistentDataContainer`'s key to the nickname in a MiniMessage formatted string.
Then it calls the `setDisplayName()` function which just makes the nickname visible everywhere. 

Now removing a nickname is a simple process
```java
public static void remove(@NotNull Player player) {
    player.getPersistentDataContainer().remove(getKey());
    player.displayName(Component.text(player.getName()));
}
```

Gets the PDC and removes any reference to the key, then set the user's display name to their username

Checking for a nickname is very very simple
```java
public static boolean has(@NotNull Player player) {
    return player.getPersistentDataContainer().has(getKey(), PersistentDataType.STRING);
}
```

Simpily checks if the PDC has the key, not much more to say

### Step 2
Applying the nickname on join

```java
@EventHandler(priority = EventPriority.LOWEST)
public void onJoin(PlayerJoinEvent event) {
    if (Nickname.has(event.getPlayer())) {
        event.getPlayer().displayName(Nickname.get(event.getPlayer()));
    }
}
```

This checks if a player has a nickname on the `PlayerJoinEvent` then if a nickname is found, it applys it by getting the nickname using the `get` function which we covered eariler

Those are the basics of QNick but here is something you may be able to use in your Gradle plugin.
*I'm not sure how to do this in Maven*

First in your `build.gradle` file add the following
```groovy
jar {
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'your.package.path.NotRunnable'
    }
}
```

Then make a new class at the location you put above with the following code

```java
package your.classes.path;

import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class NotRunnable {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "This jar file is not runnable, please put it in your server's plugin folder to use the plugin", "Not Runnable!", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
    }
}
```

Now when you build your gradle plugin and try run it as a program you'll see this

Thanks for reading, that was a short look at how QNick works, goodbye now!

Edit: Can't use `your.package.path` as package was a keyword, fixed it up and it's fine
